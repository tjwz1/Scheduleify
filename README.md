# Class Scheduling Application

This project is a class scheduling application designed to assist students in optimizing their course schedules based on credit limits and time conflicts. It includes a backend server built with Flask and a frontend for user interaction.

---

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the **Live Server** extension installed

---

### Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask
   pip install flask-cors
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Start the Flask server by running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will host the API locally.

---

### Frontend Setup

1. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Navigate to the `client` folder and locate the `index.html` file.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server**. 
   - If you do not have the Live Server extension installed, you can install it via the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.
4. Copy the preview link generated by Live Server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:3000/client/index.html`) and paste it into **Google Chrome** for the best user experience.

## Features

- **Greedy Scheduling Algorithm**: Quickly schedules classes by selecting the first available section that fits the constraints. Designed for speed but may not produce the most optimal schedule.
- **Dynamic Programming Algorithm**: Considers multiple scheduling configurations to optimize the number of classes and credits while respecting constraints.
- **Conflict Management**: Ensures no overlapping time periods or duplicate courses are added to the schedule.
- **User-Friendly Frontend**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to view and interact with their schedules.
